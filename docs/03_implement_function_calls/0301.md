# Task 01 - Create a customer account information API endpoint (20 minutes)

## Introduction

Azure OpenAI has the capacity to parse natural language and facilitate generating API calls through a mechanism known as function calling. Throughout the course of this exercise, you will create an API endpoint and then build the capacity to call this API endpoint based on user prompts.

## Description

In this task, you will load data that Contoso Suites staff has provided to you into Cosmos DB. This data contains a sample of customer account details from their Customer Information System (CIS). From there, they would like you to implement a .NET Web API endpoint exposing this customer information.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Import the data in Customers.txt into a Cosmos DB database named ContosoSuites and a collection named Customers.
2. Create a new Web API GET endpoint to retrieve customer information based on two inputs. The first is a string called `searchCriterion` and may be one of the three following values: **CustomerName**, **LoyaltyTier**, **DateOfMostRecentStay**. The second is a string called `searchValue` and will be what we want to find in relevant documents.
3. Perform a lookup against the Customers collection based on the search criterion and search value, returning all relevant documents.

## Success Criteria

- You have created a Cosmos DB collection named Customers.
- You have created a .NET Web API endpoint to allow querying against the Customers collection.
