# Task 02 - Create a function call for the customer account information API endpoint (40 minutes)

## Introduction

Function calling is a feature in OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Service. It provides the ability to produce structured JSON outputs based on functions you describe in a request. This allows organizations to extract key components needed for API calls from natural language communication and augment native chat capabilities.

## Description

In the prior task, you created an endpoint for accessing customer account information from Cosmos DB. In this task, you will show the power of function calling in Azure OpenAI Service by creating a chat completion that enables looking up customer details by name, loyalty tier, and most recent stay.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Add code to the web application that creates a GPT function called "customerLookup" and takes two parameters: `searchCriterion` and `searchValue`. The `searchCriterion` parameter should be an enumeration containing three values: CustomerName, LoyaltyTier, and DateOfMostRecentStay. This function should call the Web API project and execute a query against the customer account endpoint.
2. Add code to the web application that converts the GPT function into an Azure OpenAI FunctionDefinition and executes the customer lookup request.
3. Add code to the web application to accept a prompt from the user and submit that prompt to an Azure OpenAI GPT-4 model deployment. This prompt should be the input for your FunctionDefinition and should call the customer account endpoint. Take the results of this call and write them to a table.

## Success Criteria

- You have added a GptFunction and FunctionDefinition to the web application.
- After entering text into a free-form box and selecting the Perform Lookup button, the list of customer accounts loads, filtered by the criteria you have indicated in your natural language query.
