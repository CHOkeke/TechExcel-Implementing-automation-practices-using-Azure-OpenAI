# Task 01 - Prepare a frequently asked questions dataset (10 minutes)

## Introduction

Azure OpenAI supports adding data from a variety of Azure data sources, including Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, data from a specific URL, or uploading local files. We can process data from these resources and make them available to an Azure OpenAI deployment to allow an assistant to answer natural language user queries.

## Description

In this task, you will load data that Contoso Suites staff has provided to you into Cosmos DB. This data contains a series of frequently asked questions and information about several of their resort hotels and is one data source the company would like to use during this Azure OpenAI proof of concept.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Import the data in Resorts.txt into a database named ContosoSuites and a collection named Resorts.
2. Import the data in Hotels.txt into ContosoSuites.Hotels.

## Success Criteria
