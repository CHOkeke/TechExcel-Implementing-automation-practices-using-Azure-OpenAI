# Task 02 - Add data to the Chat playground (20 minutes)

## Introduction

Azure OpenAI supports adding data from a variety of Azure data sources, including Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, data from a specific URL, or uploading local files. We can process data from these resources and make them available to an Azure OpenAI deployment to allow an assistant to answer natural language user queries.

## Description

In the prior task, you made resort and hotel data available in Cosmos DB. In this task, you will show the Contoso Suites staff how to ask questions to a ChatGPT deployment based on the data you imported.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Create a ChatGPT 4 deployment using the default model version and with a rate limit of 10,000 tokens per minute.
2. Create a text-embedding-ada-002 deployment using the default model and with a rate limit of 120,000 tokens per minute.
3. Add a new data source for resort information in the Azure AI Studio Chat playground. Make sure that you have enabled vectorization using a text-embedding-ada-002 deployment.
4. Following is a sample customer request that a Contoso Suites customer service agent has received in the past. "I am looking for a sunny beachside resort on an island. There need to be diving opportunities nearby and I'd prefer it not to be too crowded an area. Which resorts would you recommend?" Enter this request into the chat session and note the response.
5. Replace the Chat playground data source with the hotel information data you added to Cosmos DB. Make sure that you have enabled vectorization using a text-embedding-ada-002 deployment.
6. Following is a sample customer request that a Contoso Suites customer service agent has received in the past. "Our family is celebrating my mother's 90th birthday and we want to have that celebration in Aruba. Do you have a hotel that can accommodate 19 room rentals? And are there any reception rooms at that hotel?" Enter this request into the chat session and note the response.

## Success Criteria

- You have created vectorized indexes in Azure AI Search for resorts and hotels.
- You have demonstrated how to use the Chat playground to allow ChatGPT to interact with custom data.
