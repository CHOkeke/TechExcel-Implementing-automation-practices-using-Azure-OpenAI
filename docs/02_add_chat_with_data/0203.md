# Task 03 - Add custom chat to a Streamlit dashboard (30 minutes)

## Introduction

The Azure AI Studio Chat playground is a good place to try out functionality such as adding your own data and chatting with an assistant, but it is not the only way to enable this communication. It is also possible to integrate Azure OpenAI resources into existing code bases in a variety of languages, including C#, F#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and any language supporting interactions with REST APIs.

## Description

Now that you have demonstrated some of the capabilities around Azure OpenAI and using custom data to inform responses, the Contoso Suites development team would like to incorporate an Azure OpenAI ChatGPT model in their website. To simplify matters, they would like you to demonstrate in a Streamlit dashboard how we can incorporate chat capabilities. They are not particularly concerned about user interface niceties, as that is something they are capable of doing. Instead, they want you to demonstrate the integration process.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. In the `src\ContosoSuitesDashboard` folder, Fill in the contents of `config.json` with relevant values from your Azure OpenAI service and from your Azure AI Search service.
2. The file named `site.py` contains the skeleton of a Streamlit dashboard. In the "Chat with Data" section, complete the functions named `generate_chat()`, `handle_chat_prompt()`, and `create_chat_completion()`.
3. After loading the Streamlit page, ask the following question: "Our family is celebrating my mother's 90th birthday and we want to have that celebration in Aruba. Do you have a hotel that can accommodate 19 room rentals? And are there any reception rooms at that hotel?"
4. Continue the chat conversation with this follow-up: "What other amenities does that hotel have?"

## Success Criteria

- Website users are able to enter their prompts into a textbox and submit the prompt to Azure OpenAI.
- The resulting response will appear on the webpage as a chat response.
- Session history is retained as long as the Streamlit dashboard is open but refreshing the page will reset session history.
