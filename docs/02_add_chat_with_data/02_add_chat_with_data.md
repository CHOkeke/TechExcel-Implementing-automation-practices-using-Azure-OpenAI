# Exercise 02 - Add chat with your data

## Lab Scenario

One of the most natural ways to integrate Azure OpenAI in an existing solution is to incorporate chat into an existing system. For this solution to bring the most value to an organization, however, the chat service must have access to information that may be proprietary or otherwise confidential. In this exercise, we will add custom data to augment an existing Azure OpenAI chat deployment, allowing customer service agents to review customer data in a natural language format.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Prepare a dataset in Cosmos DB for ingestion into Azure OpenAI
* Ingest data from Cosmos DB into Azure OpenAI via Azure AI Search
* Test completions using the ChatGPT playground in Azure Open AI
* Incorporate chat completions in an existing website

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
