# Exercise 04 - Implement audio transcription using Azure AI Services Speech service

## Lab Scenario

So far, we have looked at two common scenarios for extending the capabilities of OpenAI chat services: bringing your own data and function completion. There are other ways to bring OpenAI intelligence to customer support agents and the second half of this training will cover one of the biggest quality of life improvements we can see: audio transcription and intelligent operations.

In this exercise, you will incorporate audio transcription into the existing Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to transcribe pre-recorded customer service calls and offline support requests.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an Azure AI Services Speech service and test it using the OpenAI Studio Chat playground
* Incorporate audio file upload and audio transcription into the existing chat completions solution

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes
