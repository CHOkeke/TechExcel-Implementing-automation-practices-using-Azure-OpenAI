# Task 01 - Prepare a frequently asked questions dataset (10 minutes)

- Make sure learners use the storage account they created in exercise 1, as the storage account must be in the same region as Azure AI Search.
- Learners should create a new blob storage container rather than table or file storage.
- The files do not need to be in separate folders in the blob storage container.
