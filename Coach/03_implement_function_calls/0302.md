# Task 02 - Create a function call for the customer account information API endpoint (40 minutes)

- The code to implement function calling is as follows.
- The `handle_chat_prompt_with_functions()` function does three things. First, it echoes the user's prompt to the chat window. After that, it sends the prompt to Azure OpenAI. Finally, it executes the function call that Azure OpenAI returns.
  - The code for the completed `handle_chat_prompt_with_functions()` function is as follows:

    ```python
    # Echo the user's prompt to the chat window
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)

    # Send the user's prompt to Azure OpenAI and display the response
    # The call to Azure OpenAI is handled in create_chat_completion()
    # This function loops through the responses and displays them as they come in.
    # It also appends the full response to the chat history.
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        message_placeholder = st.empty()
        full_response = ""
        response = create_chat_completion_with_functions(deployment_name, st.session_state.messages)
        response_message = response.choices[0].message

        # Check if GPT returned a function call
        if response_message.function_call:
            # Get the function name and arguments
            function_name = response_message.function_call.name
            # Verify the function
            if function_name not in available_functions:
                full_response = f"Sorry, I don't know how to call the function `{function_name}`."
            else:
                function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]
                # Verify the function has the correct number of arguments
                function_args = json.loads(response_message.function_call.arguments)
                if check_args(function_to_call, function_args) is False:
                    full_response = f"Sorry, I don't know how to call the function `{function_name}` with those arguments."
                else:
                    # Call the function
                    full_response = function_to_call(**function_args)
    message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": full_response})
    ```

- The `create_chat_completion_with_functions()` function reaches out to Azure OpenAI and performs the chat completion, providing it the list of available functions and options.
  - The code for the completed `create_chat_completion_with_functions()` function is as follows:

    ```python
    # Create an Azure OpenAI client. We create it in here because each exercise will
    # require at a minimum different base URLs.
    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        base_url=f"{aoai_endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment_name}/",
        api_key=aoai_api_key,
        api_version="2023-08-01-preview"
    )
    # Create and return a new chat completion request
    # Be sure to include the "extra_body" parameter to use Azure AI Search as the data source
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model=deployment_name,
        messages=[
            {"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
            for m in messages
        ],
        functions=functions,
        function_call="auto",
    )
    ```

- The `get_customers()` function reaches out to ASP.NET Web API and performs the lookup call that you created in Exercise 03, Task 01.
  - The code for the completed `get_customers()` function is as follows. Note that you will want to replace `localhost:5292` with the location of your Web API service.

    ```python
    full_server_url = f"http://localhost:5292/Customer/?searchCriterion={search_criterion}&searchValue={search_value}"
    r = requests.get(
        full_server_url,
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    )
    if r.status_code == 200:
        return st.write(pd.read_json(r.content.decode("utf-8")))
    else:
        return f"Failure to find any customers with {search_criterion} {search_value}."
    ```
