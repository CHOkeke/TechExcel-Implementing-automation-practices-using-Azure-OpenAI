# Task 01 - Create a customer account information API endpoint (20 minutes)

- To create the Cosmos DB container, perform the following steps:
  - In the Azure portal, navigate to the Cosmos DB service associated with your resource group.
  - Select the **Data Explorer** option from the top menu.
  - In the Data Explorer, select the **New Container** button in the middle of the screen.
  - Create a new database and give it a name of `ContosoSuites`. You may safely set the database throughput either to `Autoscale` with a Database Max RU/s of `1000`, or `Manual` with a Database RU/s of `400`.
  - The new Container id should be called `Customers`. Choose a partition key, such as `/FullName` and select **OK** to create the database and container.
- After container creation finishes, import customer data using the Data Explorer:
  - In the Data menu tree for the NOSQL API left-hand menu, drill into ContosoSuites, then Customer, and finally select the Items menu option.
  - Choose the **Upload Item** menu option. Navigate to where you have saved the file "Customer.json" and upload it.
  - Uploading will succeed and import 77 entries.
- Update the Web API project to support accessing customer data from Cosmos DB by performing the following steps:
- The final code to support customer lookup should look something like this:
